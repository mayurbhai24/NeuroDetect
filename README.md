 # ðŸ§  NeuroDetect ðŸ§ 
 ### An Automated Brain Tumour Detection & Classification 
</div>
    
## Project Overview
Brain tumours are common but challenging to detect, particularly in the early stages. Early detection and classification are crucial, helping medical professionals select effective treatment options and ultimately save lives. Distinguishing between tumour typesâ€”such as glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumoursâ€”can be difficult even for skilled radiologists and surgeons. What if we could assist medical practitioners in identifying tumours faster, increasing patient turnaround and reducing costs? 

This project is inspired by that question. **Using machine learning, how can we identify tumours in MRI scans to improve early detection, prevent further complications, and accelerate treatment planning?**

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can  **accurately detect the presence of a tumour in an MRI image and identify the tumour type.**  This model aims to enhance the efficiency and precision of brain tumour diagnosis, supporting radiologists, surgeons, and researchers by:

-   Reduce diagnostic times
-   Reduce time for treatment planning
-   Increasing patient turnaround
-   Minimizing costs linked to misdiagnoses and incorrect treatments

## The Data
For this project, we will be using a mix of image data from various data sources all bundled into one folder. The dataset is a combination of three datasets: figshare, SARTAJ dataset and the Br35H dataset. The dataset was combined and collected from __[Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)__ The dataset contains 7023 MRI images of brain tumours classified into glioma, meningioma, pituitary and non-tumor. Images are already sorted and arranged to train and test folders within the **Data** directory.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distribution of the classes, image dimensions, and other patterns that may help in improving model accuracy. The images for each class was evenly disitrubuted which is important to ensure one class would not create a bias for the model. 

**Important:** During the EDA, we noticed that the dataset contains various image sizes and dimensions, not all images are the same size. The dataset also contains MRI scans taken from different angles and brain segments. This is key when it comes to preporcessing and modelling our data as it could cause problems for our model. We can see the different image size and angles taken below.

## Preprocessing 
The data preprocessing was done in two stages: one for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and another for the non-deep learning models.

For the CNN Model:
1. **Image Import**: All MRI images were loaded and preprocessed to ensure consistency across the dataset.
2. **Grayscale Conversion**: The images were converted to grayscale to reduce computational complexity while preserving relevant features.
3. **Resizing**: All images were resized to a uniform dimension to ensure consistency across the dataset, allowing them to be used in a deep learning model.
4. **Normalization**: The pixel values were normalized to fall within the range [0, 1], which helps improve model performance during training.
5. **One-Hot Encoding**: The tumor class labels (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor) were one-hot encoded to facilitate multi-class classification.

For Non-Deep Learning Models:
1. **Image Import**: MRI images were loaded similarly to the CNN model.
2. **Grayscale Conversion & Resizing**: Like the CNN preprocessing, the images were converted to grayscale and resized for consistency.
3. **Flattening**: To make the images interpretable by non-deep learning models (such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest), the images were flattened into a one-dimensional array. This transformation allows these models, which cannot inherently handle image data, to process the pixel data as input features.
4. **Feature Scaling**: The pixel values were normalized to fall between 0 and 1 to ensure the models perform optimally by avoiding large values that could dominate model learning. 

## Baseline Models
In this project, we used both deep learning and non-deep learning models for brain tumor classification. The models were trained to detect the presence of tumors and identify their types (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, or no tumor). The purpose of using both methods of modeling as a baseline is to understand how various models perform in image classification. The four main models that were trained are:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Random Forest
4. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

#### Baseline Model Results 

The results were the following for baseline accuracy:

| Model             | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| Logistic Regression | 89.74%         | 81.46%        |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 92.49%         | 88.33%        |
| Random Forest      | 83.96%         | 75.97%        |
| Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | 95.95% | 90.69% |

The baseline accuracy results show that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) outperformed all other models, achieving a high training accuracy of 95.95% and a test accuracy of 90.69%, making it the most robust model for brain tumor classification. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) followed closely with a training accuracy of 92.49% and a test accuracy of 88.33%, indicating solid performance with less overfitting than Logistic Regression. The Random Forest model performed the worst, with a training accuracy of 83.96% and test accuracy of 75.97%, indicating significant overfitting and poor generalization.

The results were the following for recall scores:
| Model                         | No Tumor Recall | Pituitary Recall | Glioma Recall | Meningioma Recall |
|:-------------------------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------:|
| Logistic Regression            | 95%             | 95%              | 71%           | 61%               |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM)   | 97%             | 97%              | 82%           | 75%               |
| Random Forest                  | 93%             | 92%              | 63%           | 51%               |
| Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | 99% | 95% | 93% | 68% |

In terms of recall, CNN achieved the highest recall for "No Tumor" (99%) and performed well on "Glioma" (93%) but struggled with "Meningioma" (68%). SVM also performed well, especially on "No Tumor" (97%) and "Pituitary" (97%), and showed better results than Logistic Regression and CNN for "Meningioma" (75%). Random Forest had a very low recall for both "Glioma" (63%) and "Meningioma" (51%).  

Confusion Matrix:

Overall, the CNN model emerged as the best-performing model (which is to be expected), while the Random Forest model was the worst. The most interesting about this is how well SVM performed for a non-deep learning model, to the point where it even performed better at recalling Meningioma compared to CNN.
