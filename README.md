 # ðŸ§  NeuroDetect ðŸ§ 
 ### An Automated Brain Tumour Detection & Classification 
</div>
    
## Project Overview
Brain tumours are common but challenging to detect, particularly in the early stages. Early detection and classification are crucial, helping medical professionals select effective treatment options and ultimately save lives. Distinguishing between tumour typesâ€”such as glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumoursâ€”can be difficult even for skilled radiologists and surgeons. What if we could assist medical practitioners in identifying tumours faster, increasing patient turnaround and reducing costs? 

This project is inspired by that question. **Using machine learning, how can we identify tumours in MRI scans to improve early detection, prevent further complications, and accelerate treatment planning?**

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can  **accurately detect the presence of a tumour in an MRI image and identify the tumour type.**  This model aims to enhance the efficiency and precision of brain tumour diagnosis, supporting radiologists, surgeons, and researchers by:

-   Reduce diagnostic times
-   Reduce time for treatment planning
-   Increasing patient turnaround
-   Minimizing costs linked to misdiagnoses and incorrect treatments

## The Data
For this project, we will be using a mix of image data from various data sources all bundled into one folder. The dataset is a combination of three datasets: figshare, SARTAJ dataset and the Br35H dataset. The dataset was combined and collected from __[Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)__ The dataset contains 7023 MRI images of brain tumours classified into glioma, meningioma, pituitary and non-tumor. Images are already sorted and arranged to train and test folders within the **Data** directory.

**Important:** Dataset contains various image sizes and dimensions, not all images are the same size. The dataset also contains MRI scans taken from different angles and brain segments.
